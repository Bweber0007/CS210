# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
 This project was designed for a grocery store to summarize their sales of produce and produce multiple reports based on user input. The problem was to identify which items were key sellers so their merchandising department could decide how to organize the shelves for consumer friendliness.

# What did you do particularly well?
  I thought that my program followed object oriented principals very well and organized the code into a clean class. I also thought that my functions were very clean and executed exactly what I wanted them to do without any excess code.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I thought that I could've used exception handling for checking user input to provide more secure and robust input handling. I also could have provided an option for the user to choose which file they want the data to be backed up to so it wasn't always the same file or made it a private member variable with a getter and setter to provide better security.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I thought that the most challenging part of the code was working with the file streams. I overcame this just through trial and error and checking zyBooks and other online sources to double check my work. I would say a tool/resource that I am getting more comfortable using are all of the online websites that support the coding community like Stack Overflow.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I think the work with file streams can be extremely important in the broader scale of programming. A lot of coding will need to be able to work with input sources like raw data and be able to output them to a different file for a more easily readable document.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
 I would say that my use of OOP's made this program maintainable and adaptable. My use of multiple functions and a class to organize the code and my use comments make this program more readable. Another thing that made my code more adaptable was my use of a file name variable so the program could be more easily changed to take a different input or output file without having to change every instance of where the file name is needed.
